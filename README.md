# SQL-Scavenger-Hunt-Handbook
SQL crash-course from Kaggle

Welcome to the SQL Scavenger Hunt!
 
I’m super excited for you all to join me in the SQL Scavenger Hunt starting tomorrow! Today I want to quickly go over how things are going to work so you know what to expect.

What to Expect

Each day over the next five days, we’re going to be focusing on using a different SQL command to find the data needed to answer a specific question. I've tried to put together exercises that won’t take more than 30 minutes from opening the email to finish.
 
How to Prepare

To help you hit the ground running, I’ve put together this handbook that introduces you to SQL and BigQuery. It covers these topics: 
What are SQL & BigQuery and why you should learn them
How to use BigQuery datasets in kernels
How to avoid common mistakes when querying big datasets
During the Scavenger Hunt, you'll be using our data science workbench, Kaggle Kernels, to write and execute code. If you're new to working in Kernels, here's a quick video overview of the environment.
